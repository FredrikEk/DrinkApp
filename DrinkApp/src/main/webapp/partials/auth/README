You need to have the database jdbc/drinkapp already setup (I suppose you all have)

Creating A Realm for DrinkApp:
Create one using
Admin Console (i.e. go to Services > Servers > GlassFish Server, right click and choose View Domain Admin Console)
Then on the left side below Common Tasks: Configurations > server Config > Security > Realms > New 

For settings, check the realmSetup.png
